## Instructions

1. Load all friends, then save the web page as an .html file
2. Download "Beautiful Soup 4" and "lxml", and use `parse_friend_urls.py` to parse friend urls
3. Download "PhantomJS", and use `login_addfriends.js` to click the add friend button for each friend url

**`parse_friend_urls.py` still has some bugs**

This was written way back when I didn't even what a JavaScript callback was (haha)
My Facebook account was suddenly locked for some reason, and I "urgently" needed to connect with my friends for "important" reasons, so after creating a new account, I used `PhantomJS` to automatically add back more than 1,000 friends within 2 hours. To be honest, that felt totally awesome.
