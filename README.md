## Instructions
1. Load all friends, then save the web page as an .html file
2. Download "Beautiful Soup 4" and "lxml", and use `parse_friend_urls.py` to parse friend urls
3. Download "PhantomJS", and use `login_addfriends.js` to find click the add friend button for each friend url

**`parse_friend_urls.py` still has some bugs**
